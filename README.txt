# Geometric distortions in GNS

## In order to estimate and apply the gd on GNS2 follow these steps
___
0. cubes_for_gd_corrections.py. Group all the cubes in cleaned (reduced from sky, flat ect and cleaned for cosmic rays)in four fits file (each for chip)
The generated cubes has the right format to be use by the astromatic software. Inspect the generated cubes.
0.1 delete_bad.py. In pricinple all the cubes used in cubes_for_gd_corrections.py are already cleaned for ban frames. In case some bad slices 
were detecte after inspection use this one.
1. run: source-extractor cube.fits. 
A MEF (multiple-extention fits) with the different pointing with am extention for each image. This cube has to be created with the cubes_for_gd_corrections.py script
Edit default.param to select the variable needed by scamp. A list of all sextractor variables can be found in default.sex 
2.run: scamp  sexctractor.cat -c scamp.conf 
Sextractor generates a catalog to feed scamp, from wich the geometric distorsion will be calculated. A header.head documente will be genarted. 
3.run: SWarp cube.fits. 
The .head file henerated by scamp is used to modificate the original cube.fits. It seems you have to named in the configuration file
4. axis_correction.py. Make the axii in the fits files generated by SWarp equal, updating the WCS information accordenglyoo
